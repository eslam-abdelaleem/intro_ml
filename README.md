This is meant to be a part of an introduction tutorial I made for Emory's IPoLS Scientific Programming in Python Bootcamp and Zewail City Winter School.
The notebook uses the MNIST dataset as an example, and applies methods like PCA, SVM, Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, and others, as part of it.
